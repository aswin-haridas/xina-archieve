During the exam, I met Amal, and we quickly became friends. It was an awesome experience; he's very friendly, and I found myself being friendly too. After the exam, which lasted an hour, I left the institution and went to fetch my bike. While doing so, I spotted [[Aji bro]] chatting with his friends. It is funny that this is a second time I am meeting him in an exam.I joined them for a conversation, and then we headed home together. On the way, I bought three juice for [[Aji bro]] and his friends.  Once back home, I spent a good chunk of time playing Far Cry 5. After indulging in some gaming, I dedicated a few hours to assisting juniors with their mini-project. Managed to complete about 50% of it. Later, I did some browsing on Google before calling it a night. Time to catch some Z's now."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Sounds like a solid day, Aswin!

Over time, his constant teasing and making fun of me became unbearable. It felt like our interactions were centered solely around finding faults or something to mock about me.  I reached a breaking point today and confronted him about it. Maybe I was a bit rash in my words, but I told him to stop talking to me. It wasn't an easy thing to do, as we've shared many good times together. However, I believe it's important to surround myself with people who uplift and support me, rather than bring me down.  I feel a mix of relief and sadness. Relief because I've taken a step towards preserving my mental well-being, and sadness because I've lost a friend. But sometimes, self-respect and peace of mind have to come first. I hope Tony understands my perspective, even if he doesn't agree with it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That takes guts, man.
